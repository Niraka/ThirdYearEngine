A third year group game engine university project.

This project took place in two phases. For the first phase I was working alone and task with creating a basic 3D rendering environment. For the second phase I was grouped with two other students and instructed to extend the rendering in to a game engine and small game.

Whilst the engine was a strong start, it didnt quite come together in time for the final presentation.
