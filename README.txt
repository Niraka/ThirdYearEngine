A third year group game engine university project.

This project took place in two phases. For the first phase I was working alone and tasked with creating a basic 3D rendering environment. For the second phase I was grouped with two other students and instructed to extend the rendering environment in to an engine and simple game.

Whilst the engine was a strong start, it didnt quite come together in time for the final presentation and is still missing a few key features.
